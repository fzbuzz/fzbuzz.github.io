I TA'ed for a discussion section of 60+ students for introduction to Computer Science. Responsibilities included lecture review, worksheet review, exam prep. Tried to create inclusive environment for new computer science students and informative reference notes. Judging by survey responses & thank you emails, I felt like I did a good job helping new students learn about computer science ðŸ¥°.
