Culture is the new frontier.

I want to build new technologies that enables the growth of our shared culture. Specifically, I want to improve our ability to express ourselves through social media, content, or expression of ideas. Creation of our shared culture is often dismissed in favor of more quantiative factors, such as physical goods, but I believe is one of the key drivers of human happiness. Our community, ability to express ourselves, and relationships are the key to building happier, more fufilling lives.

One technology that I'm particularly excited to enable this is generative AI. AI allows us to understand and produce our ideas at an unprecedented pace. It allows us to express our style and understanding without technical constraints, increasing the quality of how we interact with our worlds and culture. Soon, the primarily limitation won't be our technical ability to express, but rather our creativity and inspiration.

Ratatouille has this quote: "Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist *can* come from *anywhere*." I disagree, everyone can be a great artist and has something valuable to express, we just haven't built the tools to enable them.
