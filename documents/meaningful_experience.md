My marketing campaign for fall recruitment of my entrepreneurship club was the most meaningful experience I've had. My position was to advertise, explain, and promote entrepreneurship across UCLA. To do this, I coordinated a team of 20+ individuals, comprising different roles including design, events, operations. I was able to apply my creativity and technicial ability by coding instagram tools to identify potential members, devising creative methods for publicity, funding, alumni engagement and organizing school-wide events such as panels and tutorials to promote entrepreneurship. This resulted in our largest turnout to date and over 20k+ impressions in instagram. 

This time felt particularly meaningful to me because it was the first time I spent a very long time building something where I could see it made a difference. The fact I was able to directly quantify the impact also felt affirming. I want to create products that make a difference, and I think this experience has taught me how I can apply myself with determination to create change. It felt empowering to me that I was able to help build the entrepreneurship community at UCLA, and that much of what I learned over my education could be applied to make a impact on my community.
