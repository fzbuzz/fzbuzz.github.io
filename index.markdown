Hi! I'm a Masters Student at UCLA studying Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. 👋

I'm particularly interested in Generative AI, specifically interacting with large pretrained models in controllable and creative ways.

Right now, I'm writing my Masters Thesis at PLUS Lab, advised by [Professor Violet Peng](https://vnpeng.net/). 🙇🏻‍♂️
