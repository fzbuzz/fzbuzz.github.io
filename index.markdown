Hi, I'm a Masters Student at UCLA studying Artificial Intelligence! 👋

I'm particularly interested in Generative AI, specifically interacting with large pretrained models in controllable and creative ways. Here are some of my recent <span style="color:pink">[projects](_posts/2022-12-21-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown)</span>.

Right now, I'm conducting research and writing my Masters Thesis at PLUS Lab, advised by Professor Peng. 🙇🏻‍♂️
# Experience

I have been blessed with the opportunity to dive into AI/ML in a lot of cool settings. Thank you to all the mentors who have taught me everything I know. In particular, thank you to _Simram Motwani, Mark Edmonds, & Sorab Bhardwaj_.
