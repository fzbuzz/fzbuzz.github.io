Hi! I'm a Masters Student at UCLA studying Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. ðŸ‘‹

I'm particularly interested in Generative AI, specifically interacting with large pretrained models in controllable and creative ways.

Right now, I'm writing my Masters Thesis at PLUS Lab, advised by [Professor Violet Peng](https://vnpeng.net/). We are working on guiding Language Models with Knowledge Graphs and Concept-Based Commonsense Metrics.

Here are some <span style="color:pink">[projects]({{ site.url }}/projects/main.html)</span> I'm proud of building ðŸ¤©.
